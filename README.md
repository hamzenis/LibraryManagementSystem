# LibraryManagementSystem

Java Project at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences â€“ WS22/23

**Authors: Hamzenis Kryeziu, Kejvi Hysenbelli, Baba Alimou Barry**

Written entirely in Java and is completely OS-agnostic.

**Java 11 is required.** 12 or higher may work, but if older classes have been deprecated or removed in those versions,
then it may not work for those higher versions of Java.

This tool is still in active development and will receive periodic updates as improvements are made and bugs are found,
time permitting.

**Note:** Works best on UNIX-based systems such as macOS or Linux

# Usage

Open a Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) window, navigate to the same folder that your downloaded the
Library Management System JAR file is in, and run: <br>
```java -jar LibraryManagementSystem.jar```
